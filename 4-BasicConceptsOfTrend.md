# Definition of trend

The concept of trend is absolutely essential to the technical approach to market analysis.
All of the tools used by the chartist:
- support and resistance levels,
- price patterns,
- moving averages,
- trendlines,
- etc. 

have the sole purpose of helping to measure the trend of the market for the purpose of participating in that trend.
We often hear such familiar expressions as "always trend in the direction of the trend," "never buck the trend", or
"the trend is your friend." So let's spend a little time to define what atrend is and classify it into a few categories.

In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the market, which way it's moving. But we need a more precise
definition with which to work. First of all, markets don't generally move in a straight line in any direction.
Market moves are characterized by a series of zigzags. These zigzags resemble a series of successive waves with fairly
obvious peaks and troughs. **It is the direction of those peaks and troughs that constitudes market trend**.

Whether those peaks and troughs are moving up, down or sideways tells us the trend of the market. An uptrend would be
defined as a series of successively higher peaks and troughs; a downtrend is just the opposite, a series of declining
peaks and troughs; horizontal peaks and troughs would identify a sideways price trend.

# Trend has three directions

We've mentioned an uptrend, downtrend and sideways trend for a very good reason. Most people tend to think of markets
as being always in either an uptrend or a downtrend. The fact of the matter is that markets actually move in three directions:
up, down and sideways. It is important to be aware of this distinction because for at least a third of the time, by a conservative
estimate, prices move in a flat, horizontal pattern that is referred to as a trading range. This type of sideways action
reflects a period of equilibrium in the price level where the forces of supply and demand are in a state of relative balance.
Although we've defined a flat market as having a sideways trend, it is more commonly referred to as being trendless.

Most technical tools and systems are trend-following in nature, which means that they are primarily designed for markets
that are moving up or down. They usually work very poorly, or not at all, when markets enter these lateral or "trendless" phases.
It is during these periods of sideways market movement that technical traders experience their greatest frustration, and systems traders their
greatest equity losses. A trend-following system, by its very definition, needs a trend in order to do its stuff. The failure here lies not with the system.
Rather, **the failure lies with the trader who is attempting to apply a system designed for trending markets into a nontrending market environment**.

There are three decisions confronting the trader - whether to buy a market (go long), sell a market (go short), or do nothing (stand aside).

When a market is rising, the buying strategy is preferable. When it is falling, the second approach would be correct. However, when the market is moving sideways,
the third choice - to stay out of the market - is usually the wisest.

# Trend has three classifications

In additino to having three directions, trend is usually broken down into the three categories mentioned in the previous chapter.
Those three categories are the major, intermediate and near term trends. In reality, there are almost an infinite number of trends interacting
with one another, from the very short term trends covering minutes and hours to superlong trends lasting 50 or 100 years. Most technicians, however, limit
trend classification to three. There is a certain amount of ambiguity, however, as to how different analysts define each trend.

Dow Theory classifies the major trend as being in effect for longer than a year. Because futures traders operate in a shorter time dimension than do stock investors,
I would be inclined to shorten the major trend to anything over six months in the commodity markets. Dow defined the intermdiate, or secondary, trend as three weks
to as many months, which also appears about right for the futures markets. The near term trend is usually defined as anything less than two or three weeks.

Each trend becomes a portion of its next larger trend. For example, the intermediate trend would be a correction in the major trend. In a long term uptrend, the
market pauses to correct itself for a couple of months before resuming its upward path. That secondary correction would itself consist of shorter waves that would
be identified as near terms dips and rallies. This theme recurs many times - that each trend is part of the net larger trend and is itself comprised of smaller trends.
When someone asks what the trend is in a given market, it is difficult, if not impossible, to respond until you know which trend the person is inquiring about.
You may have to respond in the manner previously discussed by defining the three different trend classifications.

Quite a bit of misunderstanding arises because of different traders' perceptions as to what is meant by a trend. To long term position traders, a few days' to a few weeks'
price action might be insignificant. To a day trader, a two or three day advance might constitute a major uptrend. It's especially important, then, to understand the different degrees
of trend and to make sure that all involved in a transaction are talking about the same ones.

As a general statement, most trend-following approaches focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. The near term trend is used primarily for timing purposes.
In an intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate long positions.

# Support and resistance

In the previous discussion of trend, it was stated that prices move in a series of peaks and troughs and that the direction of those peaks and troughs determined the trend of the market.
Let's now give those peaks and troughs their appropriate names and, at the same time, introduce the concepts of __support__and __resistance__.

The troughs, or reaction lows, are called __support__. The term is self-explanatory and indicates that support is a level or area on the chart under the market where buying interest
is sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is halted and prices turn back up again. Usually a support level is identified beforehand by a previous reaction low.

__Resistance__ is the opposite of support and represents a price level or area over the market where selling pressure overcomes buying pressure and a price advance is turned back.
Usually a resistance level is identified by a previous peak.

In an uptrend, the resistance levels represents pauses in that uptrend and are usually exceeded at some point. In a downtrend, support levels are not sufficient to stop the decline
permanently, but are able to check it at least temporarily.

A solid grasp of the concepts of support and resistance is necessary for a full understanding of the concept of trend. For an uptrend to continue, each successive low (support level) must be
higher than the one preceding it. Each rally high (resistance level) must be higher than the one before it. If the corrective dip in an uptrend comes all the way down to the previous low,
it may be an early warning that the uptrend is ending or at least moving from an uptrend to a sideways trend. If the support level is violated, then a trend reversal from up to down is likely.

Each time a previous resistance peak is being tested, the uptrend is in an especially critical phase. Failure to exceed a previous peak in an uptrend, or the ability of prices to bounce
off the previous support low in a downtrend, is usually the first warning that the existing trend is changing. 

## How support and resistance levels reverse their roles

So far we've defined "support" as a previous low and "resistance" as a previous high. However, this is not always the case. This leads us to one of the more interesting and lesser known
aspects of support and resistance - their reversal of roles. Whenever a support or resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse their roles and become the opposite.
To understand why this occurs, perhaps it would be helpful to discuss some of the psychology behind the creation of support and resistance levels.

## The psychology of support and resistance

To illustrate, let's divide the markets participants into three categories - the longs, the shorts and the uncommitted. The longs are those traders who have already purchased contracts;
the shorts are those who have already committed themselves to the sell side; the uncommitted are those who have either gotten out of the market or remain undecided as to which side to enter.

Let's assume that a market starts to move higher from a support area where prices have been fluctuating for some time. The longs (those who bought near the support area) are delighted,
but regret not having bought more. If the market would dip back near that support area again, they could add to their long positions. The shorts now realize (or strongly suspect) that they
are on the wrong side of the market. (How far the market has moved away from that support area will greatly influence these decisions, but we'll come back to that point later.) The shorts
are hoping (and praying) for a dip back to that area where they went short so they can get out of the market where they got in (their break even point). 

Those sitting on the sidelines can be divided into two groups - those who never had a position and those who, for one reason or another,
liquidated previously held long positions in the support area. The latter group are, of course, mad at themselves for liquidating their longs prematurely and 
are hoping for another chance to reinstate those longs near where they sold them.

The final group, the undecided, now realize that prices are going higher and resolve to enter the market on the long side on the next good buying opportunity. All four groups are resolved
to "buy the next dip." They all have a "vested interest" in that support area under the market. Naturally, if prices do decline near that support, renewed buying by all four groups
will materialize to push prices up.

The more trading that takes place in that support area, the more significant it becomes because more participants have a vested interest in that area. The amount of trading in a given support
or resistance area can be determined in three ways: the amount of time spent there, volume, and how recently the trading took place.

**The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or resistance area, the more significant that area becomes**. For example, if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a 
congestion area before moving higher, that support area would be more important than if only three days of trading had occurred.

**Volume is another way to measure the significance of support and resistance**. IF a support level is formed on heavy volume, this would indicate that a large number of units changed hands,
and would mark that support level as more important than if very little trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure the intraday trading activity are especially useful
in identifying these price levels where most of the trading took place and, consequently, where support and resistance will be most likely to function.

**A third way to determine the significance of a support or resistance area is how recently the trading took place**. Because we are dealing with the reaction of traders to market movement
and to positions that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes.

Now let's turn the tables and imagine that, instead of moving higher, prices move lower. In the previous example, because prices advanced, the combined reaction of the market participants
caused each downside reaction to be met with with additional buying (thereby creating new support). However, if prices start to drop and move below the previous support area,
the reaction becomes just the opposite. All those who bought in the support area now realize that they made a mistake. For futures traders, their brokers are now calling frantically
for more margin money. Because of the highly leverage nature of futures trading, traders cannot sit with losses very long. They must put up additional margin money or liquidate their losing positions.

What created the previous support in the first place was the predominance of buy orders under the market. Now, however, all of the previous buy orders under the market have become
sell orders over the market. Support has become resistance. And the more significant that previous support area was - that is, the more recent and the more trading that took place there -
the more potent it now becomes as a resistance area. All of the factors that created support by the three categories of participants - the longs, the shorts and the uncommitted - will now function
to put a ceiling over prices on subsequent rallies or bounces.

It is useful once in a while to pause and reflect on why the price patterns used by chartists and concepts like support and resistance, actually do work. It's not because of some magic
produced by the charts or some lines drawn on those charts. These patterns work because they provide pictures of what the market participants are actually doing and enable us to determine
their reactions to market events. Chart analysis is actually a study of human psychology and the reactions of traders to changing market conditions. Unfortunately, because we live in the
fast-paced world of financial markets, we tend to rely heavily on chart terminology and shortcut expressions that overlook the underlying forces that created the pictures on the charts
in the first place. There are sound psychological reasons why support and resistance levels can be identified on price charts and why they can be used to help predict market movements.

## Support becoming resistance and vice versa: degree of penetration

A support level, penetrated by a significant margin, becomes a resistance level and vice versa. 

It was mentioned earlier that the distances prices traveled away from support or resistance increased the significance of that support or resistance. This is particularly true
when support and resistance levels are penetrated and reverse roles. For example, it was stated that support and resistance levels reverse roles only after a significant penetration.
But what constitutes significant? There is quite a bit of subjectivity involved here in determining whether a penetration is significant or not. As as benchmark, some chartists use 3% penetration
as a criteria, particularly for major support and resistance levels. Shorter term support and resistance areas would probably require a much smaller number, like 1%.
In reality, each analyst must decide for himself or herself what constitutes a significant penetration. It's important to remember, however, that support and resistance areas only reverse roles
when the market moves far enough away to convince the market participants that they have made a mistake. The farther away the market moves, the more convinced they become.

## The importance of round numbers as support and resistance

There is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines. Traders tend to think in terms of important round numbers, such as 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as
price objectives and act accordingly. These round numbers, therefore, will often act as "psychological" support or resistance levels. A trader can use this information to begin taking profits
as an important round number is approached.

The gold market is an excellent example of this phenomenon. The 1982 bear market low was right at 300$. The market then rallied to just above 500$ in the first quarter of 1983 before
falling to 400$. A gold rally in 1987 stopped at 500$ again. From 1990 to 1997, gold failed each attempt to break through 400$. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has shown a tendency to stall
at multiples of 1000.

One trading application of this principle is to avoid placing trading orders right at these obvious round numbers. For example, if the trader is trying to buy into a short term market dip
in an uptrend, it would make sense to place limit orders just above an important round number. Because others are trying to buy the market at the round number, the market may never get there.
Traders looking to sell on a bounce should place resting sell orders just below round numbers. The opposite would be true when placing protective stops on existing positions. As a general rule,
avoid placing protective stops at obvious round numbers.

In other words, protective stops on long positions should be placed below round numbers and on short positions, above such numbers. The tendency for markets to respect round numbers, and
especially the more important round numbers previously referred to, is one of those peculiar market characteristics that can prove most helpful in trading and should be kept in mind by
the technically oriented trader.

# Trendlines

Now that we understand support and resistance, let's add another building block to our arsenal of technical tools - the trendline.

The basic trendline is one of the simplest of the technical tools employed by the chartist, but is also one of the most valuable. An up trnedline is a traight line drawn upward to the right
along successive reaction lows. A down trendline is drawn downward to the right along successive rally peaks.

## Drawing a trendline

The correct drawing of trendlines is a lot like every other aspect of charting and some experimenting with different lines is usually necessary to find the correct one. Sometimes a trnedline that
looks correct may have to be redrawn. But there are some useful guidelines in the search for that correct line.

First of all, there must be evidence of a trend. This means that, for an **up trendline to be drawn, there must be at least two reaction lows with the second low higher than the first**.
Of course, it always takes two points to draw any straight line.

## Tentative versus the valid trendline

So far, all we have is a tentative trendline. In order to confirm the validity of a trendline, however, that line should be touched a third time with prices bouncing off of it.
To summarize, two points are needed to draw the trendline, and a third point to make it a valid trendline.

## How to use the trendline

Once the third point has been confirmed and the trend proceeds in its original direction, that trendline becomes very useful in a number of ways. One of the basic concepts of trend
is that a trend in motion will tend to remain in motion. As a corollary to that, once a trend assumes a certain slope or rate of speed, as identified by the trendline,
it will usually maintain the same slope. The trendline then helps not only to determine the extremities of the corrective phases, but maybe even more importantly, tells us when that
trend is changing.

In an uptrend, for example, the inevitable corrective dip will often touch or come very close to the up trendline. Because the intent of the trader is to buy dips in an uptrend,
that trendline provides a support boundary under the market that can be used as a buying area. A down trendline can be used as a resistance area for selling purposes.

As long as the trendline is not violated, it can be used to determine buying and selling areas. Very often, the breaking of the trendline is one of the best early warnings of
a change in trend.

## How to determine the significance of a trendline

Let's discuss some of the refinements of the trendline. First, what determines the significance of a trendline? The answer to that question is twofold:
- the longer it has been intact,
- the number of times it has been tested.

A trendline that has been successfully tested eight times, for example, that has continnually demonstrated its validity, is obviously a more significant trendline
that one that has only been touched three times. Also, a trendline that has been in effect for nine months is of more importance than one that has been in effect for
nine weeks or nine days. The more significant the trendline, the more confidence it inspires and the more important is its penetration.

## Trendlines should include all price action

Trendlines on bar charts should be drawn over or under the entire day's price range. Some chartists prefer to draw the trendline by connecting only the closing prices,
but that is not the more standard procedure. The closing price may very well be the most important price of the day, but it still represents only a small sample of that day's
activity. The technique of including the day's price range takes into account all of the activity and is the more common usage.

## How to handle small trendline penetrations

Sometimes prices will violate a trendline on an intraday basis, but then close in the direction of the original trend, leaving the analyst
in some doubt as to whether or not the trendline has actually been broken. 

A compromise is to keep the original trendline, but draw a new dotted line until it can be better determined which is the truer line.

Sometimes it is best to ignore the minor breach, especially if subsequent market action proves that the original line is still valid.

## What constitutes a valid breaking of a trendline?

As a general rule, **a close beyond the trendline is more significant than just an intraday penetration**. To go a step further, sometimes even a closing penetration
is not enough. Most technicians employ a variety of time and price filters in an attempt to isolate valid trendline penetrations and eliminate bad signals or "whipsaws".
One example of a price filter is the 3% penetration criteria. This price filter is used mainly for the breaking of longer term trendlines, but requires that the trendline be broken,
on a closing basis, by at least 3%. (The 3% rule doesn't apply to some financial futures, such as the interest rate markets.)

If, for example, gold prices broke a major up trendline at 400$, prices would have to close below that line by 3% of the price level where the line was broken (in this case,
prices would have to close 12$ below the trendline, or at 388$). Obviously, a 12$ penetration criteria would not be appropriate for shorter term trading. Perhaps a 1% criterion would
serve better in such cases. The % rule represents just one type of price filter. Stock chartists, for example, might require a full point penetration and ignore fractional moves.
There is tradeoff involved in the use of any type of filter. If the filter is too small, it won't be very useful in reducting the impact of whipsaws. If it's too big, the much of
the initial move will be missed before a valid signal is given. Here again, the trader must determine what type of filter is best suited to the degree of trend being followed, always making
allowances for the differences in the individuals markets.

An alternative to a price filter is a time filter. A common time filter is the two day rule. In other words, to have a valid breaking of a trendline, prices must close beyong the trendline
for two successive days. To break an up trendline, therefore, prices must close under the trendline two days in a row. A one day violation would not count. The 1-3% rule and the two day rule
are also applied to the breaking of important support and resistance levels, not just to major trend-lines. Another filter would require a friday close beyond a major breakout point
to ensure a weekly signal.

## How trendlines reverse roles

It was mentioned earlier that support and resistance levels became the opposite once violated. The same principle holds true of trendlines. In other words,
an up trendline (a support line) will usually become a resistance line once it's decisively broken. A down trendline (a resistance line) will often become a support line
once it's decisively broken. This is why it's usually a good idea to project all trendlines as far out to the right on the chart as possible even after they've been broken.
It's surprising how often old trendlines act as support and resistance lines again in the future, but in the opposite role.

## Measuring implications of trendlines

Trendlines can be used to help determine price objectives. In fact, some of the price objectives addressed that are derived from price patterns are similar to the one we'll cover here with trendlines.
Stated briefly, once a trendline is broken, prices will usually move a distance beyond the trendline equal to the vertical distance that prices achieved on the other side of the line,
prior to the trend reversal.

In other words, if in the prior uptrend, prices moved 50$ above the up trendline, then prices would be expected to drop that same 50$ below the trendline after it's broken.

# The fan principle

This brings us to another interesting use of the trendline - the fan principle. Sometimes after the violation of an up trendline, prices will decline a bit before rallying back
to the bottom of the old up trendline (now a resistance line). The term "fan principle" derives from the appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling a fan.
The important point to remember here is that the breaking of the third line is the valid trend reversal signal.

# The importance of the number three

In examining the three lines in the fan principle, it's interesting to note how often the number three shows up in the study of technical analysis and the important role it plays in so many
technical approaches. For example, the fan principle uses three lines; major bull and bear markets usually have three major phases (Dow Theory and Elliott Wave Theory); there are
three kinds of gaps (to be covered shortly); some of the more commonly known reversal patterns, such as the triple top and the head and shoulders, have three prominent peaks; there
are three different classifications of trend (major, secondary, and minor) and three trend directions (up, down and sideways); among the generally accepted continuation patterns,
there are three types of triangles - the symmetrical, ascending and descending; there are three principle sources of information - price, volume and open interest. For whatever the reason,
the number three plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical analysis.

# The relative steepness of the trendline

The relative steepness of the trendline is also important. In general, most important up trnedlines tend to approimate an average slope of 45 degrees. Some chartists simply draw a 45 degree
line on the chart from a prominent high or low and use this as a major trendline. The 45 degree line was one of the techniques favored by W. D. Gann. Such a line reflects a situation where
rpices are advancing or declining at such a rate that price and time are in perfect balance.

If a trendline is too steep, it usually indicates that prices are advancing too rapidly and that the current steep ascent will not be sustained. The breaking of that steep trendline
may be just a reaction back to a more sustainable slope closer to the 45 degree line. If a trendline is too flat, it may indicate that the uptrend is too weak and not to be trusted.

## How to adjust trendlines

Sometimes trendlines have to be adjusted to fit a slowing or an accelerating trend. For example, as shown in the previous case, if a steep trendline is broken, a slower trendline
might have to be drawn. If the original trendline is too flat, it may have to be redrawn at a steeper angle. A trendline that is too far away from the price action is obviously
of little use in tracking the trend.

In the case of an accelerating trend, sometimes several trendlines may have to be drawn at increasingly steeper angles. In my experience, however, where steeper trendlines become
necessary, it is best to resort to another tool - the moving average - which is the same as a curvilinear trendline. One of the advantages of having access to several different types
of technical indicators is being able to choose the one most appropriate for a given situation. All of the techniques covered in this book work well in certain situations,
but not so well in others. By having an arsenal of tools to fall back on, the technician can quickly switch from one tool to another that might work better in a given situation.
An accelerated trend is one of those cases where a moving average would be more useful than a series of steeper and steeper trendlines.

Just as there are several different degrees of trend in effect at any one time, so is there a need for different trendlines to measure those various trends.
A major up trendline, for example, would connect the low points of the major uptrend, while a shorter and more sensitive line might be used for secondary swings.
An even shorter line can measure the short term movements.

# The channel line

The channel line, or the return line as it is sometimes called, is another useful variation of the trendline technique. Sometimes prices trend between two parallel lines -
the basic trendline and the channel line. Obviously, when this is the case and when the analyst recognizes that a channel exists, this knowledge can be used
to profitable advantage.

The drawing of a channel line is relatively simple. In an uptrend, first draw the basic up trendline along the lows. Then draw a dotted line from the first prominent peak,
which is parallel to the basic up trendline. Both lines move up to the right, forming a channel. If the next rally reaches and backs off from the channel line, then a channel
may exist. If prices then drop back to the original trendline, then a channel probably does exist. The same holds true for a downtrend, but of course in the opposite direction.

The reader should immediately see the value of such a situation. The basic up trendline can be used for the initiation of new long positions. The cannel line can be used for short term
profit taking. More aggressive traders might even use the channel line to initiate a countertrend short position, although trading in the opposite direction of the prevailing trend can be a dangerous
and usually costly tactic. As in the case of the basic trendline, the longer the channel remains intact and the more often it is successfully tested, the more important and reliable it becomes.

The breaking of the major trendline indicates an important change in trend. But the breaking of a rising channel line has exactly the opposite meaning, and signals an acceleration of the
existing trend. Some traders view the clearing of the upper line in an uptrend as a reason to add to long positions.

Another way to use the channel technique is to spot failures to reach the channel line, usually a sign of a weakening trend. As a general rule of thumb, the failure of any move within an established
price channel to reach one side of the channel usually indicates that the trend is shifting and increases the likelihood that the other side of the channel will be broken.

The channel can also be used to adjust the basic trendline. If prices move above a projected rising channel line by a significant amount, it usually indicates a strengthening trend. Some chartists
then draw a steeper basic up trendline from the last reaction low parallel to the new channel line. Often, the new steeper support line functions better than the old flatter line.
Similarly, the failure of an uptrend to reach the upper end of a channel justifies the drawing of a new support line under the last reaction low parallel to the new resistance line over the past two peaks.

Channel lines have measuring implications. Once a breakout occurs from an existing price channel, prices usually travel a distance equal to the width of the channel.
Therefore, the user has to simply measure the width of the channel and then project that amount from the point at which either trendline is broken.

It should always be kept in mind, however, that of the two lines, the basic trendline is by far the more important and the more reliable. The channel line is a secondary use of the trendline
technique. But the use of the channel line works often enough to justify its inclusion in the chartist's toolkit.

# Percentage retracements

In all of the previous examples of uptrends and downtrends, the reader has no doubt noticed that after a particular market move, prices retrace a portion of the previous trend before resumingthe move in the original direction. These countertrend moves tend to fall into certain predictable percentage parameters. The best known application of the phenomenon is the 50% retracement.

Let's say that a market is trending higher and travels from the 100 level to the 200 level. Very often, the subsequent reaction retraces about half of the prior move, to about the 150 level,
before upward momentum is regained. This is a very well-known market tendency and happens quite frequently. Also, these precentage retracements apply to any degree of trend - major,
secondary and near term.

Besides the 50% retracement, there are minimum and maximum percentage parameters that are also widely recognized - the one-third and the two-thirds retracements.
In other words, the price trend can be divided into thirds. Usually, a minimum retracement is about 33% and a maximum about 66%. What this means is that, in a correction of a strong trend,
the market usually retraces at least a third of the previous move. This is very useful information for a number of reasons. If a trader is looking for a buying area under the market,
he or she can just compute a 33-50% zone on the chart and use that price zone as a general frame of reference for buying opportunities.

The maximum retracement parameter is 66%, which becomes an especially critical area. If the prior trend is to be maintained, the correction must stop at the two-thirds point. This then
becomes a relatively low risk buying area in an uptrend or selling area in a downtrend. If prices move beyond the two-thirds point, the odds then favor a trend reversal rather than just
a retracement. The move usually then retraces the entier 100% of the prior trend.

You may have noticed that the three percentage retracement parameters we've mentioned so far - 50%, 33% and 66% - are taken right from the original Dow Theory. When we get to the Elliott Wave Theory
and Fibonacci ratios, we will see that followers of that approach use percentage retracements of 38% and 62%. I prefer to combine both approaches for a minimum retracement zone of 33-38% and
a maximum zone of 62-66%. Some technicians round off these numbers even further to arrive at a 40-60% retracement zone.

Students of W. D. Gann are aware that he broken down the trend structure into eights. However, even Gann attached special important to the 3/8 (38%), 4/8 (50%) and 5/8 (62%) retracements numbers
and also felt it was important to divide the trend into third - 1/3 (33%) and 2/3 (66%).

# Speed resistance lines

Speaking of thirds, let's touch on another technique that combines the trendline with percentage retracements - speedlines. This technique, developed by Edson Gould, is actually an adaptation
of the idea of dividing the trend into thirds. The main difference from the percentage retracement concept is that the speed resistance lines (or speedlines) measure the rate of ascent
of descent of a trend (in other words, its speed).

To construct a bullish speedline, find the highest point in the current uptrend. From that high point on the chart, a vertical line is drawn toward the bottom of the chart to where the trend began.
That vertical line is then divided into thirds. A trendline is then drawn from the beginning of the trend through the two points marked off on the marked off on the vertical line,
representing the one-third and two-thirds points. In a downtrend, just reverse the process. Measure the vertical distance from the low point in the downtrend to the beginning of the trend,
and draw two lines from the beginning of the trend through the one-third and two-thirds points on the vertical line.

Each time a new high is set in an uptrend or a new low in a downtrend, a new set of lines must be drawn (because there is now a new high or low point). Because the speedlines are
drawn from the beginning of the trend to the one-third and two-thirds points, those trendlines may sometimes move through some of the price action. this is one case where trendlines
are not drawn under lows or over highs, but actually through the price action.

If an uptrend is in the process of correcting itself, the downside correction will usually stop at the higher speedline (the 2/3 speedline). If not, prices will drop to the lower speedline
(the 1/3 speedline). If the lower line is also broken, prices will probably continue all the way to the beginning of the prior trend. In a downtrend,
the breaking of the lower line indicates a probable rally to the higher line. If that is broken, a rally to the top of the prior trend would be indicated.

As with all trendlines, speedlines reverse roles once they are broken. Therefore, during the correction of an uptrend, if the upper line (2/3 line) is broken and prices fall to the 1/3 line
and rally from there, that upper line becomes a resistance barrier. Only when that upper line is broken would a signal be given that the old highs will probably be challenged. The same
principle holds true in downtrends.

# Gann and Fibonacci fan lines

Charting software also allows the drawing of Gann and Fibonacci fan lines. Fibonacci fan lines are drawn in the same fashion as the speedline. Except that fibonacci lines are drawn at 38%
and 62% angles. Gann lines (named after the legendary commodity trader, W.D. Gann) are trendlines drawn from prominent tops or bottoms at specific geometric angles. The most important Gann
line is drawn at a 45 degree angle from a peak or trough. Steeper Gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 63.75 degree and 75 degree angles. Flatter Gann lines can be drawn at 26.25
and 15 degree lines. It's possible to draw as many as nine different Gann lines.

Gann and Fibonacci lines are used in the same way as speedlines. They are supposed to provide support during downward corrections. Whe one line is broken, prices will usually fall
to the next lower line. Gann lines are somewhat controversial. Even if one of them works, you can't be sure in advance which one it will be. Some chartist question the validity of drawing
geometric trendlines at all.

# Internal trendlines

These are variations of the trendline that don't rely on extreme highs or lows. Instead, internal trendlines are drawn through the price action and connect as many internal peaks or troughs
as possible. Some chartists develop a good eye for this type of trendline and find them useful. The problem with internal trendlines is that their drawing is very subjective; whereas the rules
for drawing of more traditional trendlines along the extreme highs and lows are more exact.

# Reversal days

Another important building block is the reversal day. This particular chart formation goes by many names - the top reversal day, the bottom reversal day, the buying or selling climax, and the
key reversal day. By itself, this formation is not of major importance. But, taken in the context of other technical information, it can sometimes be significant.

Let's first define what a reversal day is:
> A reversal day takes place either at a top or a bottom. The generally accepted definition of a top reversal day is the setting of a new high in an uptrend, followed by a lower close
> on the same day. In other words, prices set a new high for a given upmove at some point during the day (usually at or near the opening) then weaken and actually close lower than the
> previous day's closing.

> A bottom reversal day would be a new low during the day followed by a higher close.

The wider the range for the day and the heavier the volume, the more significant is the signal for a possible near term trend reversal. Note te heavier volume on the reversal day.
Also notice that both the high and low on the reversal day exceed the range of the previous day, forming an outside day. While an outside day is not a requirement for a reversal day,
it does carry more significance.

The bottom reversal day is sometimes referred to as a selling climax. This is usually a dramatic turnaround at the bottom of a down move where all the discouraged longs have finally been forced out of
of the makret on heavy volume. The subsequent absence of selling pressure creates a vacuum over the market, which prices quickly rally to fill. The selling climax is one of the more dramatic examples
of the reversal day and, while it may not mark the final bottom of a falling market, it usually signals that a significant low has been seen.

## Weekly and monthly reversals

This type of reversal pattern shows up on weekly and monthly bar charts, and with much greater significance. On a weekly chart,
each bar represents the entire week's range with the close registered on Friday. An upside weekly reversal, therefore, would occur when the market traders lower during the week,
makes a new low for the move, but on Friday closes above the previous Friday's close.

Weekly reversals are much more significant than daily reversals for obvious reasons and are watched closely by chartists as signaling important turning points. By the same token, monthly reversals
are even more important.

# Price gaps

Price gaps are simply areas on the bar chart where no trading has taken place. In an uptrend, for example, price open above the highest price of the previous day, leaving a gap or open
space on the chart that is not filled during the day. In a downtrend, the day's highest price is below the previous day's low. Upside gaps are signs of market strength, while downside gaps
are usually signs of weakness. Gaps can appear on long term weekly and monthly charts and, when they do, are usually very significant. But they are more commonly seen on daily bar charts.

Several myths exist concerning the interpretation of gaps. Ine of the maxims often heard is that "gaps are always filled". This is simply not true. Some should be filled and others
shouldn't. We'll also see that gaps have different forecasting implications depending on which types they are and where they occur.

## Three types of gaps

There are three general types of gaps:
- the breakaway,
- runaway (or measuring) and
- exhaustion gaps.

### The breakaway gap

The breakaway gap usually occurs at the completion of an important price pattern, and usually signals the beginning of a significant market move. After a market has completed a major basing pattern,
the breaking of resistance often occurs on a breakaway gap.

Breakaway gaps usually occur on heavy volume. More often than not, breakaway gaps are not filled. Prices may return to the upper end of the gap (in the case of a bullish breakout),
and may even close a portion of the gap, but some portion of the gap is often left unfilled. As a rule, the heavier the volume after such a gap appears, the less likely it is to be filled.
Upside gaps usually act as support areas on subsequent market corrections. It's important that prices not fall below gaps during an uptrend. In all cases a close below an upward gap is sign of
weakness.

### The runaway or measuring gap.

After the move has been underway for a while, somewhere around the middle of the move, prices will leap forward to form a second type of gap (or a series of gaps) called the runaway gap.
This type of gap reveals a situation where the market is moving effortlessly on moderate volume. In an uptrend, it's a sign of market strength; in a downtrend, a sign of weakness.
Here again, runaway gaps act as support under the market on subsequent corrections and are often not filled. As in the case of the breakaway, a close below the runaway gap in a negative sign
in an uptrend.

This variety of gap is also called a measuring gap because it usually occurs at about the halfway point in a trend. By measuring the distance the trend has already traveled,
from the original trend signal or breakout, an estimate of the probable extend of the remaining move can be determined by doubling the amount already achieved.

### The exhaustion gap

The final type of gap appears near the end of a market move. After all objectives have been achieved and the other two types of gaps (breakaway and runaway) have been identified,
the analyst should begin to expect the exhaustion gap. Near the end of an uptrend, prices leap forward in a last gasp, so to speak. However, that upward leap quickly fades and prices turn
lower within a couple of days or within a week. When prices close under that last gap, it is usually a dead giveaway that the exhaustion gap has made its appearance. This is a classic example
where failling below a gap in an uptrend has very bearish implications.

## The island reversal

This takes us to the island reversal pattern. Sometimes after the upward exhaustion gap has formed, prices will trade in a narrow range for a couple of days or a couple of weeks before gapping
to the downside. Such a situation leaves the few days of price action looking like an "island" surrounded by space or water. The exhaustion gap to the upside followed by a breakaway gap
to the downside completes the island reversal pattern and usually indicates a trend reversal of some magnitude. Of course, the major significance of the reversal depends on where prices
are in the general trend structure.

# Conclusion

This chapter introduced introductory technical tools that I consider to be the building blocks of chart analysis - support and resistance, trendlines and channels, percentage retracements,
speed resistance lines, reversal days, and gaps. Every technical approach covered in later chapters uses these concepts and tools in one form or another. Armed with a better understanding of these
concepts, we're now ready to begin a study of price patterns.
