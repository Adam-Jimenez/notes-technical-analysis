# Introduction

This chapter is primarly intended for those readers who are unfamiliar with bar chart construction. We'll begin by discussing 
the different types of charts available and then turn our focus to the most communly used chart - __the daily bar chart__.
We'll look at how the price data is read and plotted on the chart. Volume and open interest are also included in addition to price.
We'll then look at other variations of the bar chart, including longer range weekly and monthly charts. 

# Types of charts available

__The daily bar chart__ has already been acknowledge as the most widely used type of chart in technical analysis. There are, however,
other types of charts also used by technicians, such as:
- line charts, 
- point and figure charts,  
- candlesticks.

It's called a bar chart because each day's range is represented by a vertical bar. The bar chart shows the open, high, low and closing prices.
The tic to the right of the vertical bar is the closing price. The opening price is the tic to the left of the bar.

Many chartists believe that because the closing price is the most critical price of the trading day, a line (or close-only) chart is a more valid
measure of price activity.

A third type of chart is the point and figure chart. The point and figure chart shows the same price action but in a more compressed format.

The x columns show rising prices and the o columns, declining prices. Buy and sell signals are more precise and easier to spot on the point and figure chart than
on the bar chart. This type of chart also has a lot more flexibility.

# Candlesticks

Candlesticks charts are the Japanese version of bar charting and have become very popular in recent years among western chartists.
The Japanese candlestick records the same four prices as the traditional bar chart - the open, close, high and the low.
The visual presentation differs however. On the candlestick chart, a thin line (called the shadow) shows the day's price range
from the high to the low. A wider portion of the bar (called the real body) measuresvthe distance between the open and the close.
If the close is higher than the open, the real body is white (positive). If the close is lower than the open, the real body is black (negative).

The key to candlesticks charts is the relationship between the open and the close. Possibly because of the growing populairty of candlesticks, western
chartists now pay a lot more attention to the opening tic on their bar charts. You can do everything with a candlestick chart that you can do with a bar chart.
In other words, all the technical tools and indicators we'll be showing you for the bar chart can also be used on candlesticks.

# Arithmetic versus logarithmic scale

Charts can be plotted using arithmetic or logarithmic price scales. For some types of analysis, particularly for very long range trend analysis,
there may be some advantage to using logarithmic charts. 

On the arithmetic scale, the vertical price scale shows an equal distance for each price unit of change. On the log scale, however, the percentage increases
get smaller as the price scale increases. The distance from points 1 to 2 is the same as the distance from points 5 to 10 because they both represent
the same doubling in price. On the arithmetic scale, a move from 5 to 10 would be the same distance as a move from 50 to 55, even though the former represents
a doubling in price, while the latter is a price increase of only 10%.

# Construction of the daily bar chart

The construction of the daily bar chart is extremely simple. The bar chart is both a price and a time chart. The vertical axis shows a scale representing the price of the contract.

the horizontal axis records the passage of time. Dates are marked along the bottom of the chart. All the user has to do is plot a vertical bar in the appropriate day
from the day's high to the day's low (called the range). Place a horizontal tic to the right of the vertical bar identifying the daily closing price.


The reason for placing the tic to the right of the bar is to distinguish it from the opening price, which chartists record to the left of the bar.

Once that day's activity has been plotted, the user moves one day to the right to plot the next day's action. Most chart services use five day weeks.
Weekends are not shown on the chart. Whenever an exchange is closed during the trading week, the day's space is left blank. The bars along the bottom of the chart
measure volume.

# Volume

Another piece of important information should be included on the bar chart - volume. Volume represents the total amount of trading activity in that market for that day.
It is the total number of futures contracts traded during the day or the number of common stock shares that change hands on a given day in the stock market.
The volume is record by a vertical bar at the bottom of the chart under that day's price bar. A higher volume bar means the volume was heavier for that day.
A smaller bar represents lighter volume. A vertical scale along the bottom of the chart is provided to help plot the data.

# Futures open interest

Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that are held by market participants at the end of the day. Open interest is the numbers of outstanding
contracts held by the long or the shorts, not the total of both. Remember, because we're dealing with futures contracts, for every long there must also be a short.
Therefore, we only have to know the totals on one side. Open interest is marked on the chart with a solid line along the bottom, usually just above the volume but below the price.

## Total versus individual volume and open interest numbers in futures

Futures chart services, along with most futures technicians, use only the total volume and open interest figures. Although figures are available for each individual delivery month,
the total figures for each commodity market are the ones that are used for forecasting purposes. There is a good reason for this.

In the early stages of a futures contract's life, volume and open interest are usually quite small. The figures build up as the contract reaches maturity. In the last couple of months
before expiration, however, the numbers begin to drop again. Obviously, traders have to liquidate open positions as the contract approaches expiration. Therefore, the increase
in the numbers in the first few months of life and the decline near the end of trading have nothing to do with market direction and are just a function of the limited feature
of a commodity futures contract. To provide the necessary continuity in volume and open interest numbers, and to give them forecasting value, the total numbers are generally used.

## Volume and open interest reported a day late in futures

Futures volume and open interest numbers are reported a day late. Therefore, the chartist must be contect with a day's lag in obtaining and interpreting the figures. The numbers
are usually reported during the following day's trading hours, but too late for publication in the day's financial newspapers. Estimated volume figures are available after the markets
close and are included in the following morning's paper. Estimated volume numbers are just that, but they do at least give the futures technician some idea of whether trading
activity was heavier or lighter the previous day. In the morning paper, what the reader gets is the last day's futures prices along with an estimated volume figure.
Official volume and open interest numbers, however, are given for the day before. Stock chartists don't have that problem. Volume totals for stocks are immediately available.

## The value of individual volume and open interest numbers in futures

The individual open interest numbers in futures do provide valuable informatino. They tell us which contracts are the most liquid for trading purposes. As a general rule, trading
activity should be limited to those delivery months with the highest open interest. Months with low open interest numbers should be avoided. As the term implies, higher open
interest means that there is more interest in certain delivery months.

# Weekly and monthly bar charts

We've focused so far on the daily bar chart. However, be aware that a bar chart can be constructed for any time period. The intra-day bar chart measures the hig, low, and last prices
for periods as short as five minutes. The average daily bar chart covers from six to nine months of price action. For longer range trend analysis, however, weekly and monthly
bar charts must be used.

On the weekly chart, one bar represents the price activity for the entire week. On the monthly chart, each bar shows the entire month's price action.
Obviously, weekly and monthly charts compress the price action to allow for much longer range trend analysis. A weekly chart can go back as much as five years and
a monthly chart up to 20 years. It's a simple technique that helps the chartist study the markets from a longer range perspective - a valuable perspective that is often
lost by relying solely on daily charts.

# Conclusion

Now that we know how to plot a bar chart, and having introduced three basic sources of information:
- price,
- volume,
- open interest,

we're ready to look at how that data is interpreted. Remember that the chart only records the data. It itself, it has little value. It's much like a paint brush and canvas.
By themselves, they have no value. In the hands of a talented artist, they can help create beautiful images. Perhaps an even better comparison is a scalpel.
In the hands of a gifted surgeon, it can help save lives. In the hands of most of us, a scalpel is not only useless, but might even be dangerous.

A chart can become an extremely useful tool in the art or skill of market forecasting once the rules are understood.
