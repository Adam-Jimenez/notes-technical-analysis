# Introduction

Most technicians in the financial markets use a multidimensional approach to market analysis
by tracking the movement of three sets of figures - price, volume and open interest. Volume
analysis applies to all markets. Open interest applies primarily to futures markets. Chapter 3
discussed the construction of the daily bar chart and showed how the three figures were plotted
on that type of chart. It was stated then that even though volume and open interest figures are
available for each delivery month in futures markets, the total figures are the ones generally
used for forecasting purposes. Stock chartists simply plot total volume along with the accompanying
price.

Most of the discussion of charting theory to this point has concentrated mainly on price action 
with some mention of volume. In this chapter, we'll round out the three dimensional approach
by taking a closer look at the role played by volume and open interest in the forecasting process.

# Volume and open interest as secondary indicators

Let's begin by placing volume and open interest in their proper perspective. Price is by far
the most important. Volume and open interest are secondary in importance and are used primarily
as confirming indicators. Of those two, volume in the most important.

## Volume

Volume is the number of entities traded during the time period under study. Because we'll be
dealing primarily with daily bar charts, our main concern is with daily volume. That daily volume
is plotted by a vertical bar at the bottom of the chart under the day's price action.

Volume can be plotted for weekly bar charts as well. In that case, total volume for the week would
simply be plotted under the bar representing that week's price action. Volume is usually not used,
however, on monthly bar charts.

## Open interest in futures

The total number of outstanding or unliquidated contracts at the end of the day is open interest.

In figure 7.2, open interest is the solid line plotted on the chart under its corresponding price
data for the day, but above the volume bars. Remember that official volume and open interest
figures are reported a day late in the furtures markets and are, therefore, plotted with a one day
lag. (Only estimated volume figures are available for the last trading day.) That means that
each day the chartist plots the high, low and closing price bar for the last day of trading,
but plots the official volume and open interest figures for the previous day.

Open interest represents the total number of outstanding longs or shorts in the market, not
the sum of both. Open interest is the number of contracts. A contract must have both a buyer
and a seller. Therefore, two market participants - a buyer and a seller - combine to create
only one contract. The open interest figure reported each day is followed by either a positive
or negative number showing the increase or decrease in the number of contracts for that day.
It is those changes in the open interest levels, either up or down, that give the chartist clues
as to the changing character of market participation and give open interest its forecasting value.

### How changes in open interest occur

In order to grasp the significance of how changes in the open interest numbers are interpreted,
the reader must first understand how each trade produces a change in those numbers.

Every time a trade is completed on the floor of the exchange, the open interest is affected in one
of three ways - it increases, decreases, or stays unchanged. Let's see how those changes occur.

| Buyer | Seller | Change in open interest |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Buys new long | Sells new short | Increases |
| Buys new long | Sells old long | No change |
| Buys old short | Sells new short | No change |
| Buys old short | Sells old long | Decreases |

In the first case, both the buyer and seller are initiating a new position and a new contract
is established. In case 2, the buyer is initiating a new long position, but the seller is merely
liquidating an old long. One is entering and the other exiting a trade. The result is a standoff
and no change takes place in the number of contracts. In case 3, the same thing happens
except this time it is the seller who is initiating a new short and the buyer who is covering
an old short. Because one of the traders is entering and the other exiting a trade, again no change
is produced. In case 4, both traders are liquidating an old position and the open interest
decreases accordingly.

To sum up, if both participants in a trade are initiating a new position, the open interest will
increase. If both are liquidating an old position, the open interest will decline. If, however,
one is initiating a new trade while the other is liquidating an old trade, open interest will
remain unchanged. By looking at the net change in the total open interest at the end of the day,
the chartist is able to determine whether money is flowing into or out of the market.
This information enables the analyst to draw some conclusions about the strength or weakness
of the current price trend.

### General rules for interpreting volume and open interest

The futures technician incorporates volume and open interest information into market analysis.
The rules for the interpretation of volume and open interest and generally combined because they
are so similar. There are, however, some distinctions between the two that should be addressed.
We'll begin here with a statement of the general rules for both. Having done that, we'll then treat
each one separately before combining them again at the end.

| Price | Volume | Open Interest | Market |
| ----- | ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| Rising | Up | Up | Strong |
| Rising | Down | Down | Weak |
| Declining | Up | Up | Weak |
| Declining | Down | Down | Strong |

If volume and open interest are both incnreasing, then the current price trend will probably
continue in its present direction. If volume and open interest are declining, the action can be
viewed as a warning that the current price trend may be nearing an end. Having said that, let's
now take a look at volume and open interest separately.

# Interpretation of volume for all markets

The level of volume measures the intensity or urgency behind the price move.
Heavier volume reflects a higher degree of intensity or pressure. By monitoring the level of volume
along with price action, the technician is better able to gauge the buying or seeling pressure
behind market moves. This information can then be used to confirm price movement or warn that a
price move is not to be trusted.

To state the rule more consisely, volume should increase or expand in the direction of the
existing price trend. In an uptrend, volume should be heavier as the price moves higher, and
should decrease or contract on price dips. As long as this pattern continues, volume is said
to be confirming the price trend.

The chartist is also watching for signs of divergence. Divergence occurs if the penetration of 
previous high by the price trend takes place on declining volume. This action alerts the chartistto diminishing buying pressure. If the volume also shows a tendency to pick up on price dips,
the analyst begins to worry that the uptrend is in trouble.

## Volume as confirmation in price patterns

During our treatment of price patterns in Chapters 5 and 6, volume was mentioned several times as an important confirming indicator. One of the first signs of a head and shoulders top occured
when prices moved into new highs during the formation of the head on light volume with heavier activity on the subsequent decline to the neckline. The double and triple tops saw lighter volume
on each successive peak followed by heavier downside activity. Continuation patterns, like the triangle, should be accompanied by a gradual drop off in volume, As a rule, the resolution of
all price patterns (the breakout point) should be accompanied by heavier trading activity if the signal given by that breakout is real.

In a downtrend, the volume should be heavier during down moves and lighter on bounces. As long as that pattern continues, the selling pressure is greater than buying pressure and the downtrend
should continue. It's only when that patterns begins to change that the chartist starts looking for signs of a bottom.

## Volume precedes price

By monitoring the price and volume together, we're actually using two different tools to measure the same thing - pressure. By the mere fact that prices are trending higher, we can see that
there is more buying than selling pressure. It stands to reason then that **the greater volume should take place in the same direction as the prevailing trend**.
Technicians believe that volume precedes price, meaning that the loss of upside pressure in an uptrend or downside pressure in a downtrend actually shows up in the volume figures before 
it is manifested in a reversal of the price trend.

## On balance volume

Technicians have experimented with many volume indicators to help quantify buying or selling pressure. Trying to "eyeball" the vertical volume bars along the bottom of the chart is not always
precise enough to detect significant shifts in the volume flow. The simplest and best known of these volume indicators in on balance volume or OBV. Developed and popularized by Joseph Granville
in his 1963 book, Granville's New Key to Stock Market Profits, OBV actually produces a curving line on the price chart. This line can be used either to confirm the quality of the current price
trend or warn of an impending reversal by diverging from the price action.

Figre 7.6 shows the price chart with the OBV line along the bottom of the chart instead of the volume bars. Notice how much easier it is to follow the volume trend with the OBV line.
It's when the volume line fails to move in the same direction as price that a divergence exists and warns of a possible trend reversal.

## Alternatives to OBV

The on balance volume line does its job reasonably well, but it has some shortcomings. For one thing, it assigns an entire day's volume a plus or minus value. Suppose a arket closes up on
the day by some minimal amount such as one or two tics. Is it reasonable to assign all of that day's activity a positive value?
Or consider a situation where the market spends most of the day on the upside, but then closes slightly lower. Should all of that day's volume be given a negative value? To resolve these questions,
technicians have experimented with many variations of OBV in an attempt to discover the true upside and downside volume.

One variation is to give greater weight to those days where the trend is the strongest. On an up day, for example, the volume is multiplied by the amount of the price gain. 
This technique still assigns positive and negative values, but gives greater weight to those days with greater price movement and reduces the impact of those days where the actual price change is minimal.

There are more sophisticated formulas that blend volume (and open interest) with price action. James Sibbet's Demand Index, for example, combines price and volume into a leading market indicator.
The Herrick Payoff Index uses open interest to measure money flow. (See Appendix A for an explanation of both indicators).

It should be noted that volume reporting in the stock market is much more useful than in the futures markets. Stock trading volume is reported immediately, while it is reported a day late for futures.
Levels of upside and downside volume are also available for stocks, but not in futures. The availability of volume data for stocks an each price change during the day has facilitated an even more advanced
indicator called Money Flow, developed by Laszlo Birinyi, Jr. This real-time version of OBV tracks the level of volume on each price change in order to determine if money is flowing 
into or out of a stock. This sophisticated calculation, however, requires a lot of computer power and isn't readily available to most traders.

These more sophisticated variations of OBV have basically the same intent - **to determine whether the heavier volume is taking place on the upside (bullish) or the downside (bearish)**.
Even with its simplicity, the OBV line still does a pretty good job of tracking the volume flow in a market - either in futures or stocks. And OBV is readily available on most charting software.
Most charting packages even allow you to plot the OBV line right over the price data for even easier comparison.

## Other volume limitations in futures

We've already mentioned the problem of the one day lag in reporting futures volume. There is also the relatively awkward practice of using total volume numbers to analyze individual
contracts instead of each contract's actual volume. There are good reasons for using total volume. But how does one deal with situations when some contracts close higher and others lower in the
same futures market on the same day? Limit days produce other problems. Days when markets are locked limit up usually produce very light volume. This is a sign of strength as the numbers of buyers
so overwhelm the sellers that prices reach the maximum trading limit and cease trading. According to the traditional rules of interpretation, light volume on a rally is bearish. The light volume
on limit days is a violation of that principle and can distort OBV numbers.

Even with theses limitations, however, volume analysis can still be used in the futures markets, and the technical trader would be wella dvised to keep a watchful eye on volume indications.

# Interpretation of open interest in futures

The rules for interpreting open interest changes are similar to those for volume, but require additional explanation.

1. With prices advancing in an uptrend and total open interest increasing, new money is flowing into the market reflecting aggressive new buying and is considered bullish.
2. If, however, prices are rising and open interest declines, the rally is being caused primarily by short covering. Money is leaving rather than entering the market.
This action is considered bearish because the uptrend will probably run out of steam once the necessary short covering has been completed.
3. With prices in a downtrend and open interest rising, the technician knows that new money is flowing into the market, reflecting aggressive new short selling.
This action increases the odds that the downtrend will continue and is considered bearish.
4. If total open interest is declining along with declining prices, the price decline is being caused by discouraged or losing longs being forced to liquidate their positions.

This action is believe to indicate a strengthening technical situation because the downtrend will probably end once open interest has declined sufficently to show that most losing longs have completed
their selling.

Let's summarize these four points:
1. Rising open interest in an uptrend is bullish.
2. Declining open interest in an uptrend is bearish.
3. Rising open interest in a downtrend is bearish.
4. Declining open interest in a downtrend is bullish.

## Other situations where open interest is important

In addition to the preceding tendencies, there are other market situations where a study of open interest can prove useful.

1. Toward the end of majro market moves, where open interest has been increasing throughout the price trend, a leveling off or decline in open interest is often an early warning of a change in trend.
2. A high open interest figure at market tops can be considered bearish if the price drop is very sudden. This means that all of the new longs established near the end of the uptrend now have losing
positions.
Their forced liquidation will keep prices under pressure until the open interest has decline sufficiently. As an example, let's assume that an uptrend has been in effect for some time.
Over the past month, open interest has increased noticeably. Remember that every new open interest contract has one new long and one new short. Suddenly, prices begin to drop sharply and fall
below the lowest price set over the past month. Every single new long established during that month now has a loss.

The forced liquidation of those longs keeps prices under pressure until they have all been liquidated. Worse still, their forced selling often begins to feed on itself and,
as prices are pushed even lower, causes additional margin selling by other longs and intensifies the new price decline. As a corollary to the preceding point, an unusually high open interest
in a bull market is a danger signal.

3. If open interest builds up noticeably during a sideways consolidation or a horizontal trading range, the ensuing price move intensifies once the breakout occurs. This only stands to reason.
The market is in a period of indecision. No one is sure which direction the trend breakout will take. 
The increase in open interest, however, tells us that a lot of traders are taking positions in anticipation of the breakout. Once that breakout does occur,
a lot of traders are going to be caught on the wrong side of the market.

Let's assume we've had a three month trading range and that the open interest has jumped by 10,000 contracts. This means that 10,000 new long positions and 10,000 new short positions have been taken.
Prices then break out on the upside and new three month highs are established. Because prices are trading at the highest point in three months, every single short position (all 10,000 of them) initiated
during th eprevious three months now shows a loss. The scramble to cover those losing shorts naturally causes additional upside pressure on prices, producing even more panic. Prices remain strong
until all or most of those 10,000 short positions have been offset by buying into the market strength. If the breakout had been to the downside, then it would have been the longs doing the scrambling.

The early stage of any new trend immediately following a breakout is usually fueled by forced liquidation by those caught on the wrong side of the market. The more traders caught on the wrong side
(manifested in the high open interest), the more severe the response to a sudden adverse market move. On a more positive note, the new trend is further aided by those on the right side of the market
whose judgment has been vindicated, and who are now using accumulated paper profits to finance additional positions. It can be seen why the greater increase in open interest during a trading range
(or any price formation for that matter), the greater the potential for the subsequent price move.

4. Increasing open interest at the completion of a price pattern is viewed as added confirmation of a reliable trend signal. The breaking of the neckline, for example, of a head and shoulders bottom is
more convincing if the breakout occurs on increasing open interest along with the heavier volume. The analyst has to be careful here. Because the impetus following the initial trend signal is
often caused by those on the wrong side of the market, sometimes the open interest dips slightly at the beginning of a new trend. This initial dip in the open interest can mislead the unwary
chart reader, and argues against focusing too much attention on the open interest changes over the very short term.

# Summary of volume and open interest rules

Let's summarize some of the more important elements of price, volume and open interest.

1. Volume is used in all markets; open interest mainly in futures.
2. Only the total volume and open interest are used for futures.
3. Increasing volume (and open interest) indicate that the current price trend will probably continue.
4. Declining volume (and open interest) suggest that the priced trend may be changing.
5. Volume preceded price. Changes in buying or selling pressure are often detected in volume before price.
6. On balance volume (OBV), or some variation thereof, can be used to more accurately measure the direction of volume pressure.
7. Within an uptrend, a sudden leveling off or decline in open interest often warns of a change in trend. (applies to futures only)
8. Very high open interest at market tops is dangerous and can intensify downside pressure. (applies to futures only)
9. A buildup in open interest during consolidation periods intensifies the ensuing breakout (applies to futures only).
10. Increases in volume (and open interest) help confirm the resolution of price patterns or any other significant chart developments that signal the beginning of a new trend.

# Blowoffs and selling climaxes

One final situation not covered so far that deserves mention is the type of dramatic market action that often takes place at tops and bottoms - blowoffs and selling climaxes.
Blowoffs occur at major market tops and selling climaxes at bottoms. In futures, blowoffs are often accompanied by a drop in open interest during the final rally. In the case of a blowoff at market tops,
prices suddely begin to rally sharply after a long advance, accompanied by a large jump in trading activity and then peak abruptly. In a selling climax bottom, prices suddenly drop sharply on heaving
trading activity and rebound as quickly.

# Commitments of traders report

Our tratment of open interest would not be complete without mentioning the Commitments of Traders (COT) Report, and how it is used by futures technicians as a forecasting tool. The report is
released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commision (CFTC) twice a month - a mid-month report and one at month's end. The report breaks down the open interest numbers into three categories:
- large hedgers, 
- large speculators 
- small traders. 

The large hedgers, also called commercials, use the futures markets primarily for hedging purposes. Large speculators include the large
commodity funds, who rely primarily on mechanical trend-following systems. The final category of small traders includes the general public, who trade in much smaller amounts.

# Watch the commercials

The guiding principle in analyzing the Commitments Report is the belief that the large commercial hedgers are usually right, while the traders are usually wrong. That being the case, the idea
is to place yourself in the same positions as the hedgers and in the opposite positions of the two categories of traders. For example, a bullish signal at a market bottom would occur when the commercials
are heavily net long while the large and small traders are heavily net short. In a rising market, a warning signal of a possible top would take place when the large and small traders become
heavily net long at the same time that the commercials are becoming heavily net short.

# Net trader positions

It is possible to chart the trends of the three market groups, and to use those trends to spot extremes in their positions. One way to do that is to study the net trader positions published in
Futures Charts (Published by Commodity Trend Service). That charting service plots three lines that show the net trader positions for all three groups on a weekly price chart for each market 
going back four years. By providing four years of data, historical comparisons are easily done. Nick Van Nice, the published of that chart service, looks for situations where the commercials are
at one extreme, and the two categories of traders at the other, to find buying and selling opportunities. Even if you don't use the COT Report as a primary input in your trading decisions, it's not a bad
idea to keep an eye on what those three groups are doing.

# Open interest in options

Our coverage of open interest has concentrated on the futures markets. Open interest plays an important role in options trading as well. Open interest figures are published each day for put and call
options on futures markets, stock averages, industry indexes, and individual stocks. While open interest in optiosn may not be interpreted in exactly the same way as in futures, it tells us
essentially the same thing - where the interest is and the liquidity. Some option traders compare call open interest (bulls) to put open interest (bears) in order to measure market sentiment. Others
use option volume.

# Put / Call Ratios

Volume figures for the options markets are used essentially the same way as in futures and stocks - that is, they tell us the degree of buying or selling pressure in a given market.
Volume figures in options are broken down into call volume (bullish) and put volume (bearish). by monitoring the volume in calls versus puts, we are able to determine the degree of bullishness or
bearishness in a market. One oef the primary uses of volume data in optinos trading is the construction of put/call volume rations. When optiosn traders are bullish, call volume exceeds put volume and
the put/call ratio falls. A bearish attitude is reflected in heavier put volume and a higher put/call ratio. The put/call ratio is usually viewed as a contrary indicator. A very high ratio signals an
oversold market. A very low ratio is a negative warning of an overbought market.

# Combine option sentiment with technicals

Options traders use open interest and volume put/call figures to determine extremes in bullish or bearish sentiment. These sentiment readings work best when combined with technical measures such
as support, resistance, and the trend of the underlying market. Since timing is so crucial in options, most option traders are technically oriented.

# Conclusion

That concludes our coverage of volume and open interest, at least for now. Volume analysis is used in all financial markets - futures, options and stocks. Open interest applies only to futures
and options. But, since futures and options are traded on so many stock market vehicles, some understanding of how open interest works can be useful in all three financial arenas.
In most of our discussions so far, we've concentrated on daily bar charts. The next step is to broaden our time horizon and to learn how to apply the tools we've learened to weekly and monthly 
charts in order to perform long range trend analysis. We'll accomplish that in the next chapter.
