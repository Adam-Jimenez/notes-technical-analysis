# Introduction

The chart patterns covered in this chapter are called continuation patterns.

These patterns usually indidicate that the sideways price action on the chart 
is nothing more than a pause in the prevailing trend, and that the next move will be
in the same direction as the trend that preceded the formation

This distinguishes this group of patterns from those in the previous chapter, which usually
indicate that a major trend reversal is in progress.

Another difference between reversal and continuation patterns is their time duration.
Reversal patterns usually take much longer to build and represent major trend changes.
Continuation patterns, on the other hand, are ususually shorter term in duration and 
are more accurately classified as near term or intermediate patterns.

Notice the constant use of the term "usually". The treatment of all chart patterns deals
of necessity with general tendencies as opposed to rigid rules. There are always exceptions.
Even the grouping of price patterns into different categories sometimes become tenuous.
Triangles are usually continuation patterns, but sometimes act as reversal patterns. Although
triangles are usually considered intermediate patterns, they may occasionally appear on long term
charts and take on major trend significance. A variation of the triangle - the inverted variety -
usually signals a major market top. Even the head and shoulders pattern, the best known of the 
major reversal patterns, will on occasion be seen as a consolidation pattern.

Even with allowances for a certain amount of ambiguity and the occasional exception, chart patterns
do generally fall into the above two categories and, if properly interpreted, can help the chartist
determine what the market will probably do most of the time.

# Triangles

Let's begin our treatment of continuation patterns with the triangle.

There are three types of triangles:
- symmetrical,
- ascending,
- descending.

Some charists include a fourth type of triangle known as an expanding triangle, or broadening formation.

Each type of triangle has a slightly different shape and has different forecasting implications.

## The symmetrical triangle

The symmetrical triangle (or the coil) is uaully a continuation pattern. It represents
a pause in the existing trend after which the original trend is resumed. In the example
in Figure 6.1a, the prior trend was up, so that the percentages favor resolution of the triangular
consolidation on the upside. If the trend had been down, then the symmetrical triangle would
have bearish implications.

The minimum requirement for a triangle is four reversal points. Remember that it always takes
two points to draw a trendline. Therefore, in order to draw two converging trendlines, each line
must be touched at least twice. In Figure 6.1.a, the triangle actually begins at point 1,
which is where the consolidation in the uptrend begins. Prices pull back to point 2 and then
rally to point 3. Point 3, however, is lower than point 1. The upper trendline can only be
drawn once priecs have declined from point 3.

Notice that point 4 is higher than point 2. Only when prices have rallied from point 4 can the
lower upslating line be drawn. It is at this point that the analyst begins to suspect that
he is dealing with the symmetrical triangle.

Now there are four reversal points (1, 2, 3 and 4)  and two converging trendlines.

While the minimum requirements is four reversal points, many triangles have six reversal points.

This means that there are actually three peaks and three troughs that combine to form five waves within
the triangle before the uptrend resumes.

### Time limit for triangle resolution

There is a time limit for the resolution of the pattern, and that is the point where the two lines
meet - at the apex. As a general rule, prices should breakout out in the direction of the prior
trend somewhere between two-thirds to three-quarters of the horizontal width of the triangle.
That is, the distance from the vertical base on the left of the pattern to the apex at the far right.
Because the two lines must meet at some point, that time distance can be measured once the two
converging lines are drawn. An upside breakout is signaled by a penetration of the upper trendline.
If prices remain within the triangle beyond the three-quarters point, the triangle begins to lose
its potency, and usually means that prices will continue to drift out to the apex and beyond.

The triangle, therefore, provides an interesting combination of price and time.
The converging trendlines give the price boundaries of the pattern, and indicate at what point 
the pattern has been completed and the trend resumed by the penetration of the upper trendline
(in the case of an uptrend). But these trendlines also provide a time target by measuring
the width of the pattern. If the width were 20 weeks long, then the breakout should take place
sometime between the 13th and the 15th week.

The actual trend signal is given by a closing penetration of one of the trendlines. Sometimes
a return move will occur back to the penetrated trendline after the breakout.
In an uptrend, that line has become a support line. In a downtrend, the lower line becomes
a resistance line once it's broken. The ape also acts as an important support or resistance level 
after the breakout occurs. Various penetration criteria can be applied to the breakout, similar
to those covered in the previous two chapters.
A minimum penetration criterion would be a closing price outside the trendline and not just an
intraday penetration.

### Importance of Volume

Volume should diminish as the rpice swings narrow within the triangle. This tendency for volume
to contract is true of all consolidation patterns. But the volume should pick up noticeably
at the penetration of the trendline that completes the pattern. The return move should be on light
volume with heavier activity again as the trend resumes.

Two other points should be mentioned about volume. As is the case with reversal patterns, volume
is more important on the upside than on the downside. An increase in volume is essential
to the resumption of an uptrend in all consolidation patterns.

The second point about volume is that, even though trading activity diminishes during formation
of the pattern, a close inspection of the volume usually gives a clue as to whether 
the heavier volume is occuring during the upmoves or downmoves. In an uptrend, there should be
a slight tendency for volume to be heavier during the bounces and lighter on the price dips.

### Measuring technique

Triangles have measuring techniques. In the case of the symmetrical triangle, there are a couple
of techniques generally used. The simplest technique is to measure the height of the vertical line
at the widest part of the triangle (the base) and measure that distance from the breakout point.

The second method is to draw a trendline from the top of the base (at point A) parallel
to the lower trendline. This upper channel line then becomes the upside target in an uptrend.
It is possible to arrive at a rough time target for prices to meet the upper channel line.
Prices will sometime shit the channel line at the same time the two converging lines meet the apex.

## The ascending triangle

The ascending and descending triangles are variations of the symmetrical, but have different forecasting implications. Firgures 6.3a and b show examples of an ascending triangle. Notice that the
upper trendline is flat, while the lower line is rising. This pattern indicates that buyers are
ore aggressive than sellers. It is considered a bullish pattern and is usually resolved with
a breakout to the upside.

Both the ascending and descending triangles differ from the symmetrical in a very important sense. No matter where in the trend structure the ascending or descending triangles appear, they have
very definite forecasting implications. The ascending triangle is bullish and the descending 
triangle is bearish. The symmetrical triangle, by contrast, is inherently a neutral pattern.
This does not mean, however, that the symmetrical triangle does not have forecastin value.
On the contrary, because the symmetrical triangle is a continuation pattern, the analyst must
simply look to see the direction of the previous trend and then make the assumption that the
previous trend will continue.
Let's get back to the ascending triangle. As already stated, more often than not, the ascending 
triangle is bullish. The bullish breakout is signaled by a decisive closing above the flat upper
trendline. As in the case of all valid upside breakouts, volume should see a noticeable increase
on the breakout. A return move back to the support line (the flat upper line) is not unusual
and should take place on light volume.

### Measuring technique

The measuring technique for the ascending triangle is relatively simple. Simply measure the
height of the pattern at its widest point and project that vertical distance from the breakout
point. This is just another example of using the volatility of a price pattern to determine
a minimum price objective.

### The ascending triangle as a bottom

While the ascending triangle most often appears in an uptrend and is considered a continuation 
pattern, it sometimes appears as a bottoming pattern. It is not unusual toward the end of a
downtrend to see an ascending triangle develop. However, even in this situation, 
the interpretation of the pattern is bullish. The breaking of the upper line signals
completion of the base and is considered a bullish signal. Both the ascending and descending
triangles are sometimes also referred to as right angle triangles.

## The descending triangle

The descending triangle is just a mirror image of the ascending, and is generally considered
a bearish pattern. Notice in figures 6.4a and b the descending upper line and the flat lower
line. This pattern indicates that sellers are more aggressive than buyers, and is usually 
resolved on the downside. The downside signal is registered by a decisive close under the lower
trendline, usually on increased volume. A return move sometimes occurs which should encounter
resistance at the lower trendline.

The measuring technique is exactly the same as the ascending triangle.

### The descending triangle as a top

While the descending triangle is a continuation pattern and usually is found within downtrends,
it is not unusual on occasion for the descending triangle to be found at market tops.
This type of pattern is not that difficult to recognie when it does appear in the top setting.
In that case, a close below the flat lower line would signal a major trend reversal to the
downside.

### The volume pattern

The volume pattern in both the ascending and descending triangles is very similar in that the
volume diminishes as the pattern works itself out and then increases on the brekaout. As in
the case of the symmetrical triangle, during the formation the chartist can detect subtle shifts
in the volume pattern coinciding with the swings in the price action. This means that in the
ascending pattern, the volume tends to be slightly heavier on bounces and lighter on dips.
In the descending formation, volume should be heavier on the downside and lighter during the
bounces.

### The time factor in triangles

One final factor to be considered on the subject of triangles is that of the time dimension.
The triangle is considered an intermediate pattern, meaning that iusually takes longer than a 
month to form, but generally less than three months. A triangle that lasts less than a month is 
probably a different pattern, such as a pennant, which will be covered shortly.

As mentioned earlier, triangles sometimes appear on long term price charts, but their basic
meaning is always the same.

## The broadening formation

This next price pattern is an unusual variation of the triangle and is relatively rare. It is
actually an inverted triangle or a triangle turned backwards. All of the triangular patterns
examined so far show converging trendlines. The broadening formation is just the opposite.

As the pattern in Figure 6.5 shows, the trendlines actually diverge in the broadening formation,
creating a picture that looks like an expanding triangle. It is also called a megaphone top.

The volume pattern also differs in this formation. In the other triangular patterns, volume
tends to diminish as the price swings grow narrower. Just the opposite happens in the broadening
formation. The volume tends to expand along with the wider price swings. This situation
represents a market that is out of control and unusually emotional. Beucase this
pattern also represents an unusual amount of public participation, it most often occurs at major
market tops. The expanding pattern, therefore, is usually a bearish formatino.
It generally appears near the end of a major bull market.

# Flags and pennants

The flag and pennant formations are quite common. They are usually treated together because they
are very similar in appearance, tend to show up at about the same place in an existing trend, and
have the same volume and measuring criteria.

The flag and pennant represent brief pauses in a dynamic market move. In fact,
one of the requirements for both the flag and the pennant is that they be preceded by a sharp
and almost straight line move. They represent situations where a steep advance or decline has
gotten ahead of itself, and where the market pauses briefly to "catch its breath" before 
running off again in the same direction.

Flags and pennants are among the most reliable of continuation patterns and only rarely
produce a trend reversal. To begin with, notice the steep price advance preceding the formations
on heavy volume. Notice also the dramatic drop off in activity as the consolidation patterns
form and then the sudden burst of activity on the upside breakout.

## Construction of flags and pennants

The construction of the two patterns differs slightly. The flag resembles a parallelogram or
rectangle marked by two parallel trendlines that tend to slope against the prevailing trend.
In a downtrend, the flag would have a slight upward slope.

The pennant is identified by two converging trendlines and is more horizontal. It very closely
resembles a small symmetrical triangle. An important requirement is that volume should dry up
noticeably while each of the patterns is forming.

Both patterns are relatively short term and should be completed within one to three weeks.
Pennants and flags in downtrends tend to take even less time to develop, and often last no
longer than one of two weeks. Both aptterns are completed on the penetration of the upper
trendline in an uptrend. The breaking of the lower trendline would signal resumption of
downtrends. The breaking of those trendlines should take place on heavier volume. As usual,
upside volume is more critically important than downside volume.

## Measuring implications

The measuring implications are similar for both patterns. Flags and pennants are to
"fly at half-mast" from a flagpole. The flagpole is the prior sharp advance or decline.
The term "half-mast" suggests that these minor continuation patterns tend to appear at about
the halfway point of the move. In general, the move after the trend has resumed will duplicate
the flagpole or the move just prior to the formation of the pattern.

## Summary

Let's summarize the more important points of both patterns.

1. They are both preceded by an almost straight line move (called a flagpole) on heavy volume.
2. Prices then pause for about one to three weeks on very light volume.
3. The trend resumes on a burst of trading activity.
4. Both patterns occur at about the midpoint of the market move.
5. The pennant resembles a small horizontal symmetrical triangle.
6. The flag resembles a small parallelogram that slopes against the prevailing trend.
7. Both patterns take less time to develop in downtrends.
8. Both patterns are very common in the financial markets.

# The wedge formation

The wedge formation is similar to a symmetrical triangle both in terms of its shape and
the amount of time it takes to form. Like the symmetrical triangle, it is identified by
two converging trendlines that come together at an apex. In terms of the amount of time it takes
to form, the wedge usually lasts more than one month but no more than three months,
putting it into the intermediate category.

What distinguishes the wedge is its noticeable slant. The wedge pattern has a noticeable 
slant either to the upside or the downside. As a rule, like the flag pattern, the wedgeslants against the prevailing trend. Therefore, **a falling wedge is considered bullish and a rising wedge
is bearish**.

## Wedges as tops and bottom reversal patterns

Wedges show up most often within the existing trend and usually constitute continuation patterns.
The wedge can appear at tops or bottoms and signal a trend reversal. But that type of 
situation is much less common. Near the end of an uptrend, the chartist may observe a clearcut
rising wedge. Because a continuation wedge in an uptrend should slope downward against the 
prevailing trend, the rising wedge is a clue to the chartist that this is a bearish and not a
bullish pattern. At bottoms, a falling wedge would be a tip-off of a possible end of a bear
trend.

Whether the wedge appears in the middle or the end of a market move, the market analyst should
always be guided by the general maxim that a rising wedge is bearish and a falling wedge is
bullish.

# The rectangle formation

The rectangle formation often goes by other names, but is usually easy to spot on a price chart.
It represents a pause in the trend during which prices move sideways between two parallel
horizontal lines.

The rectangle is sometimes referred to as a trading range or a congestion area. In Dow Theory,
it is referred to as a line. Whatever it is called, it usually represents just a consolidation
period in the existing trend, and is usually resolve in the direction of the market trend
that preceded its occurence. In terms of forecasting value, it can be viewed as being similar 
to the symmetrical triangle but with flat instead of converging trendlines.

A decisive close outside either the upper or lower boundary signals completion of the rectangle
and points the direction of the trend. The market analyst must always be on the alert, however,
that the rectangular consolidation does not turn into a reversal pattern. The three peaks
might initially be viewed as a possible triple top reversal pattern.

## The importance of the volume pattern

One important clue to watch for is the volume pattern. Because the price swings in both
directions are fairly broad, the analyst should keep a close eye on which moves have the
heavier volume. If the rallies are on heavier and the setbacks on lighter volume, then the 
formation is probably a continuation in the uptrend. If the heavier volume is on the
downside, then it can be considered a warning of a possible trend reversal in the works.

## Swings within the range can be traded

Some chartists trade the swings within such a pattern by buying dips near the bottom and
selling rallies near the top of the range. This technique enables the short term trader to
take advantage of the well defined price boundaries, and profit from an otherwise trendless
market. Because the positions are being taken at the extremes of the range, the risks are 
relatively small and well defined. If the trading range remains intact, this countertrend
trading approach works quite well. When a breakout does occur, the trader not only exits
the last losing trade immediately, but can reverse the previous position by initiating a new
trade in the direction of the new trend. Oscillators are especially useful in sideways trading
markets, but less useful once the breakout has occurred for reasons discussed in chapter 10.

Other traders assume the rectangle is a continuation pattern and take long positions near
the lower end of the price band in an uptrend, or initiate short positions near the top of
the range in downtrends. Others avoid such trendless markets altogether and await a clearcut
breakout before committing their funds. Most trend-following systems perform very poorly during
these periods of sideways and trendless market action.

## Other similarities and differences

In terms of duration, the rectangle usually falls into the one to three month category,
similar to triangles and wedges.
The volume pattern differs from other continuation patterns in the sense
that the broad price swings prevent the usual dropoff in activity seen in other such patterns.

The most common measuring technique applied to the rectangle is based on the height of the price
range. Measure the height of the trading range, from top to bottom, and then project that 
vertical distance from the breakout point. This method is similar to the other vertical
measuring techniques already mentioned, and is based on the volatility of the market.
When we cover the count in point and figure charting, we'll say more on the question of
horizontal price measurements.

Everything mentioned so far concerning volume on breakouts and the probability of return moves
applies here as well. Because the upper and lower boundaries are horizontal and so well
defined in the rectangle. Support and resistance levels are more clearly evident. This means
that, on upside breakouts, the top of the former price band should now provide solid
support on any selloffs. After a downside breakout in downtrends, the bottom of the trading
range (the previous support area) should now provide a solid ceiling over the market on any
rally attempts.

# The measured move

The measured move, or the swing measurement as it is sometimes called, describes the phenomenon
where a major market advance or decline is divided into two equal and parallel moves.
For this approach to work, the market moves should be fairly orderly and well defined.
The measured move is really just a variation of some of the techniques we've already touched
on. We've seen that some of the consolidation patterns, such as flags and pennants, usually
occur at about the halfway point of a market move. We've also mentioned the tendency of markets
to retrace about a third to a half of a prior trend before resuming that trend.

In the measured move, when the chartist sees a well-defined situation, such as in Figure 6.10a,
with a rally from point A to point B followed by a countertrend swing from point B to point C
(which retraces a third to a half of wave AB), it is assumed that the next leg in the uptrend
(CD) will come close to duplicating the first leg (AB). The height of wave (AB), therefore, is
simply measured upward from the bottom of the correction at point C.

# The continuation head and shoulders pattern

In the previous chapter, we treated the head and shoulders pattern at some length and described 
it as the best known and most trustworthy of all reversal patterns. The head and shoulders
pattern can sometimes appear as a continuation instead of a reversal pattern.

In the continuation head and shoulders variety, prices trace out a pattern that looks very
similar to a sideways rectangular pattern except that the middle trough in an uptrend tends to
be lower than either of the shoulders. In a downtrend, the middle peak in the consolidation
exceeds the other two peaks. The result in both cases is a head and shoulders pattern turned
upside down. Because it is turned upside down, there is no chance of confusing it with the
reversal pattern.

# Confirmation and divergence

The principle of confirmaion is one of the common themes running throughout the entire subject
of market analysis, and is used in conjunction with its counterpart - divergence. We'll
introduce both concepts here and explain their meaning, but we'll return to them again and again
throughout the book because their impact is so important. We're discussing confirmation here
in the context of chart aptterns, but it applies to virtually every aspect of technical
analysis. 

**Confirmation** refers to the comparison of all technical signals and indicators to
ensure that most of those indicators are pointing in the same direction and are confirming
one another.

**Divergence** is the opposite of confirmation and refers to a situation where technical
indicators fail to confirm one another. While it is being used here in a negative sense,
divergence is a valuable concept in market analysis, and one of the best early warning signals
of impending trend reversals. We'll discuss the principle of divergence at greater length in
chapter 10, "Oscillators and contrary opinion".

# Conclusion

This concludes our treatment of price patterns. We stated earlier that the three pieces of
raw data used by the technical analyst were price, volume and open interest. Most of what
we've said so far has focused on price. Let's take a closer look now at volume and
open interest and how they are incorporated into the analytical process.
