# Introduction

The chart patterns covered in this chapter are called continuation patterns.

These patterns usually indidicate that the sideways price action on the chart 
is nothing more than a pause in the prevailing trend, and that the next move will be
in the same direction as the trend that preceded the formation

This distinguishes this group of patterns from those in the previous chapter, which usually
indicate that a major trend reversal is in progress.

Another difference between reversal and continuation patterns is their time duration.
Reversal patterns usually take much longer to build and represent major trend changes.
Continuation patterns, on the other hand, are ususually shorter term in duration and 
are more accurately classified as near term or intermediate patterns.

Notice the constant use of the term "usually". The treatment of all chart patterns deals
of necessity with general tendencies as opposed to rigid rules. There are always exceptions.
Even the grouping of price patterns into different categories sometimes become tenuous.
Triangles are usually continuation patterns, but sometimes act as reversal patterns. Although
triangles are usually considered intermediate patterns, they may occasionally appear on long term
charts and take on major trend significance. A variation of the triangle - the inverted variety -
usually signals a major market top. Even the head and shoulders pattern, the best known of the 
major reversal patterns, will on occasion be seen as a consolidation pattern.

Even with allowances for a certain amount of ambiguity and the occasional exception, chart patterns
do generally fall into the above two categories and, if properly interpreted, can help the chartist
determine what the market will probably do most of the time.

# Triangles

Let's begin our treatment of continuation patterns with the triangle.

There are three types of triangles:
- symmetrical,
- ascending,
- descending.

Some charists include a fourth type of triangle known as an expanding triangle, or broadening formation.

Each type of triangle has a slightly different shape and has different forecasting implications.

## The symmetrical triangle

The symmetrical triangle (or the coil) is uaully a continuation pattern. It represents
a pause in the existing trend after which the original trend is resumed. In the example
in Figure 6.1a, the prior trend was up, so that the percentages favor resolution of the triangular
consolidation on the upside. If the trend had been down, then the symmetrical triangle would
have bearish implications.

The minimum requirement for a triangle is four reversal points. Remember that it always takes
two points to draw a trendline. Therefore, in order to draw two converging trendlines, each line
must be touched at least twice. In Figure 6.1.a, the triangle actually begins at point 1,
which is where the consolidation in the uptrend begins. Prices pull back to point 2 and then
rally to point 3. Point 3, however, is lower than point 1. The upper trendline can only be
drawn once priecs have declined from point 3.

Notice that point 4 is higher than point 2. Only when prices have rallied from point 4 can the
lower upslating line be drawn. It is at this point that the analyst begins to suspect that
he is dealing with the symmetrical triangle.

Now there are four reversal points (1, 2, 3 and 4)  and two converging trendlines.

While the minimum requirements is four reversal points, many triangles have six reversal points.

This means that there are actually three peaks and three troughs that combine to form five waves within
the triangle before the uptrend resumes.

### Time limit for triangle resolution

There is a time limit for the resolution of the pattern, and that is the point where the two lines
meet - at the apex. As a general rule, prices should breakout out in the direction of the prior
trend somewhere between two-thirds to three-quarters of the horizontal width of the triangle.
That is, the distance from the vertical base on the left of the pattern to the apex at the far right.
Because the two lines must meet at some point, that time distance can be measured once the two
converging lines are drawn. An upside breakout is signaled by a penetration of the upper trendline.
If prices remain within the triangle beyond the three-quarters point, the triangle begins to lose
its potency, and usually means that prices will continue to drift out to the apex and beyond.

The triangle, therefore, provides an interesting combination of price and time.
The converging trendlines give the price boundaries of the pattern, and indicate at what point 
the pattern has been completed and the trend resumed by the penetration of the upper trendline
(in the case of an uptrend). But these trendlines also provide a time target by measuring
the width of the pattern. If the width were 20 weeks long, then the breakout should take place
sometime between the 13th and the 15th week.

The actual trend signal is given by a closing penetration of one of the trendlines. Sometimes
a return move will occur back to the penetrated trendline after the breakout.
In an uptrend, that line has become a support line. In a downtrend, the lower line becomes
a resistance line once it's broken. The ape also acts as an important support or resistance level 
after the breakout occurs. Various penetration criteria can be applied to the breakout, similar
to those covered in the previous two chapters.
A minimum penetration criterion would be a closing price outside the trendline and not just an
intraday penetration.

### Importance of Volume

Volume should diminish as the rpice swings narrow within the triangle. This tendency for volume
to contract is true of all consolidation patterns. But the volume should pick up noticeably
at the penetration of the trendline that completes the pattern. The return move should be on light
volume with heavier activity again as the trend resumes.

Two other points should be mentioned about volume. As is the case with reversal patterns, volume
is more important on the upside than on the downside. An increase in volume is essential
to the resumption of an uptrend in all consolidation patterns.

The second point about volume is that, even though trading activity diminishes during formation
of the pattern, a close inspection of the volume usually gives a clue as to whether 
the heavier volume is occuring during the upmoves or downmoves. In an uptrend, there should be
a slight tendency for volume to be heavier during the bounces and lighter on the price dips.

### Measuring technique

Triangles have measuring techniques. In the case of the symmetrical triangle, there are a couple
of techniques generally used. The simplest technique is to measure the height of the vertical line
at the widest part of the triangle (the base) and measure that distance from the breakout point.

The second method is to draw a trendline from the top of the base (at point A) parallel
to the lower trendline. This upper channel line then becomes the upside target in an uptrend.
It is possible to arrive at a rough time target for prices to meet the upper channel line.
Prices will sometime shit the channel line at the same time the two converging lines meet the apex.

## The ascending triangle

The ascending and descending triangles are variations of the symmetrical, but have different forecasting implications. Firgures 6.3a and b show examples of an ascending triangle. Notice that the
upper trendline is flat, while the lower line is rising. This pattern indicates that buyers are
ore aggressive than sellers. It is considered a bullish pattern and is usually resolved with
a breakout to the upside.
