# Introduction

Charles Dow and his partner Edward Jones founded Dow Jones & Company in 1882.

Most of what we call technical analysis has its origins in theories proposed by Dow around 1900.

Dow Theory still forms the cornerstone of the study of technical analysis, even in the face of today's
sophisticated computer technology and newer technical indicators.

On July 3, 1884, Dow published the first stock market average composed of eleven stocks:
nine railroad companies and two manufacturing firms. Dow felt that these eleven stocks provided
a good indication of the economic health of the country.

In 1897, Dow determined that two separate indices would better represent that health and created
 a 12 stock industrial index and a 20 stock rail index.
 
By 1928 the industrial index had grown to include 30 stocks, as it stands today. His index remains
a vital tool for market technicians 80 years afeter his death.

Unfortunately for us, Dow never wrote a book on his theory. Instead he set down his ideas in a series of editorials
that The Wall Street Hournal published around the turn of the century.

In 1903, the year after Dow's death, S.A. Nelson compiled these essays into a book entitled __The ABC of Stock Speculation__.
In that work, Nelson first coined the term "Dow's Theory." Richard Russell, who wrote the introduction to a 1978 reprint,
compared Dow's contribution to stock market theory with Freud's contribution to psychiatry. In 1922, William Peter Hamilton
(Dow's associate and successor at the Journal) categorized and published Dow's tenets in a book entitled __The Stock Market Barometer__.
Robert Rhea developed the theory even further in the __Dow Theory__, published in 1932.

Dow applied his theoretical work to the stock market averages that he created; namely the Industrials and the Rails.
Hoewever, most of his analytical ideas apply equally well to all market averages. 

This chapter will describe the six basic tenets of Dow Theory and will discuss how these ideas fit into a modern study of technical analysis.

# Basic tenets

## 1. The averages discount everything

The sum and tendency of the transactions of the Stock Exchange represent the sum of all Wall Street's knowledge of the past, immediate and remote,
applied to the discounting of the future. There is no need to add to the averages, as some statisticians do, elaborate compilations of commodity
price index numbers, bank clearings, fluctuations in exchange, volume of domestic and foreign trades or anything else. Wall Street considers all
these things.

Sound familiar? The idea that the markets reflect every possible knowable factor that affects overall supply and deman is one of the premises of
technical theory. The theory applies to market averages, as well as it does to individual markets. While the markets cannot anticipate events
such as earthquakes and various other natural calamities, they quickly discount such occurrences, 
and almost instantaneously assimilate their affects into the price action.

## 2. The market has three trends

Before discussing how trneds behave, we must clarify what Dow considered a trend.

Dow defined an uptrend as a situation in which each successive rally closes higher than the previous rally high 
and each successive rally low also closes higher than the previous rally low. In other words, an uptrend has a pattern of rising peaks
and troughs. The opposite situation, with successively lower peaks and troughs, defines a downtrend. Dow's definition has withstood the test of time
and still forms the cornerstone of trend analysis.

Dow believed that the laws of action and reaction apply to the markets just as they do to the physical universe. He wrote,
>Records of trading show that in many cases when a stock reaches top it will have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest figures.
>If after such a move, the price agains recedes, it is liable to decline some distance.

Dow considered a trend to have three parts:
- primary,
- secondary,
- minor,
which he considered to the tide, waves and ripples of the sea. The primary trend represents the tide, the secondary or intermediate trend
represents the waves that make up the tide and the minor trends behave like ripples on the waves.

An observer can determine the direction of the tide by noting the highest point on the beach reached by successive waves. If each successive wave reaches further
inland than the preceding one, the tide is flowing in. When the high point of each successive wave recedes, the tide has turned out and is ebbing.
Unline actual ocean tides, which last a matter of hours, Dow conceived of market tides as lasting for more than a year and possibly for several years.

The secondary (or intermediate) trend represents corrections in the primary trend and usually lasts three weeks to three months. These intermediate corrections
generally retrace between one-third and two-third of the previous trend movement and most frequently about half of the previous move.

According to Dow, the minor (or near term) trend usually lasts less than three weeks. This near term trend represents fluctuations in the intermediate trend.

## 3. Major trends have three phases.

Dow focused his attention on primary or major trends, which he felt usually takes place in three distinct phases:
- an accumulation phase,
- a public participation phase,
- a distribution phase.
The accumulation phase represents informed buying by the mo st astute investors. If the previous trend was down, then at this point these astute investors
recognize that the market has assimilated all the so-called "bad" news. The public participation phase, where most technical trend-followers begin to participate,
occurs when prices begin to advance rapidly and business news improves. The distribution phase takes place when newspapers begin to print increasingly bullish stories;
when economic news is better than ever; and when speculative volume and public participation increase. During this last phase the same informed investors who began to "accumulate"
near the bear market bottom (when no one else wanted to buy) begin to "distribute" before anyone else starts selling.

Students of Elliott Wave Theory will recognize this division of a major bull market into three distinct phases. R. N. Elliott elaborated upon Rhea's work in __Dow Theory__,
to recognize that a bull market has three major, upward movements.

## 4. The averages must confirm each other

Dow, in referring to the Industrial and Rail Averages, meant that no import bull or bear market signal could take place unless both averages gave the same signal,
thus confirming each other. He felt that both averages must eceed a previous secondary peak to confirm the inception or continuation of a bull market.
He did not believe that the signals had to occur simultaneously, but recognized that a shorter length of time between the two signals provided stronger
confirmation. When the two averages diverged from one another, Dow assumed that the prior trend was still maintained.

## 5. Volume must confirm the trend

Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in confirming price signals. Simply stated, volume should expand or increase in the direction
of the major trend. In a major uptrend, volume would then increase as prices move higher, and diminish as prices fall. In a downtrend, volume should increase
as prices drop and diminish as they rally. Dow considered volume a secondary indicator. He based his actualy buy and sell signals entirely on closing prices.

Today's sophisticated volume indicators help determine whether volume is increasing or falling off. Savvy traders then compare this information to price action
to see if the two are confirming each other.

## 6. A trend is assumed to be in effect until it gives definite signals that it has reversed

This tenet forms much of the foundation of modern trend-following approaches. It relates a physical law to market movement, which states that an object in motion
(in this case a trend) tends to continue in motion until some external force causes it to change direction. A number of technical tools are available to traders
to assist in the difficult task of spotting reversal signals, including the study of support and resistance levels, price patterns, trendlines and moving averages.
Some indicators can provide even earlier warning signals of loss of momentum. All of that not withstanding, the odds usually favor that the existing trend will continue.

The most difficult task for a Dow theorist, or any trend-follower for that matter, is being able to distinguish between a normal secondary correction in an existing trend
and the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction. Dow theorists often disagree as to when the market gives an actual reversal signal.

# The use of closing prices and the presence of lines

Dow relied exclusively on closing prices. He believed that averages had to close higher than a previous peak or lower than a previous trough to have significance.
Dow did not consider intraday penetrations valid. When traders speak of lines in the averages, they are refering to horizontal patterns that sometimes occur on the charts.
These sideways trading ranges usually play the role of corrective phases and are usually referred to as consolidations. In more modern terms, 
we might refer to such lateral patterns as "rectangles".

# Some criticisms of Dow theory

Dow Theory has done well over the years in identifying major bull and bear markets, but has not escaped criticism. On average, Dow Theory misses 20 to 25% of a move before
generating a signal. Many traders consider this to be too late. A Dow Theory buy signal usually occurs in the second phase of an uptrend as price penetrates a previous
intermediate peak. This is also, incidentally, about where most trend-following technical systems begin to identify and participate in existing trends.

In response to this criticism, traders must remember that Dow never intended to anticipate trends; rather he sought to recognize the emergence of major bull and bear markets
and to capture the large middle portion of important market moves.

Available records suggest that Dow's Theory has performed that function reasonably well. From 1920 to 1975, Dow Theory signals captured 68% of the moves in the Industrial
and Transportation Averages and 67% of those in the S&P 500 Composite Index. Those who criticize Dow Theory for failing to catch actual market tops and bottoms lack
a basic understanding of the trend-following philosophy.

# Stocks as economic indicators

Dow apparently never intended to use his theory to forecast the direction of the stock market. He felt its real value was to use stock market direction
as a barometric reading of general business conditions. We can only marvel at Dow's vision and genius. In addition to formulating a great deal of today's price
forecasting methodology, he was among the first to recognize the usefulness of stock market averages as a leading economic indicator.

# Dow theory applied to futures trading

Dow's work considered the behavior of stock averages. While most of that original work has significant application to commodity futures, there are some important
distinctions between stock and futures trading. For one thing, Dow assumed that most investors follow only the major trends and would use intermediate corrections 
for timing purposes only. Dow considered the minor or near term trends to be unimportant.

Obviously, this is not the case in futures trading in which most traders who follow trends trade the intermediate instead of the major trend. These traders
must pay a great deal of attention to minor wings for timing purposes. If a futures trader expected an intermediate uptrend to last for a couple of months,
he or she would look for short term dips to signal purchases. In an intermediate down-trend, the trader would use minor bounces to signal short sales.
The minor trend, therefore, becomes extremely important in futures trading.

# Conclusion

This chapter presented a relatively quick review of the more important aspects of the Dow Theory. It will become clear, as you continue through this book,
that an understanding and appreciation of Dow Theory provides a solid foundation for any study of technical analysis. Much of what is discussed in the following
chapters represents some adaptation of Dow's original theory. The standard definition of a trend, the classification of a trend into three categories and phases,
the principles of confirmation and divergence, the interpretation of volume and the use of percentage retracements (to name a few), all derive, in one way or another,
from Dow Theory.
